one_liner: Real-time and accelerated ML for fundamental sciences
description: >
  Fast ML Lab is a research collective of physicists, engineers, and computer scientists
  interested in deploying machine learning algorithms for unique and challenging scientific applications. Our projects
  range from real-time, on-detector and low latency machine learning applications to high-throughput
  heterogeneous computing big data challenges. We are interested in deploying sophisticated machine
  learning algorithms to advance the exploration of fundamental physics from the world's biggest colliders
  to the most intense particle beams to the cosmos.
